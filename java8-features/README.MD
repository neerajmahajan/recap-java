8##### Interfaces
    * An interface can now have static methods.
    * An Interface can now also have default methods. (Means methods with implementations).
    * A default method can call abstract methods.
    * when a class implements multiple interfaces and same default method is provided by multipl interfaces then compiler fails and concrete class needs to provide the implementation. However if default method is provided in one of the super class then that get resolved(used).
